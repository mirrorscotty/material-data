=============
Code to calculate material properties of foods as a function of temperature.

This includes a set of Choi-Okos equations (Choi and Okos 1986) as well as 
several functions related to diffusivity and drying rate of pasta. The
diffusivity and isotherm models come primarily from *The Handbook of Food
Engineering* (Second Edition), Chapter 10, and functions for pasta composition
and thermal properties are mostly for the transport model from Zhu 2012.
